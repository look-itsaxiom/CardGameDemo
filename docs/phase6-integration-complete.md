## Technical Implementation Details

### GameEngine.ts Integration

```typescript
// Phase 6 Components - Effects Engine
private effectRegistry: EffectTypeRegistry;
private stackManager: StackManager;
private triggerDetector: TriggerDetector;
private requirementValidator: RequirementValidator;

// Initialization in dependency order
this.effectRegistry = EffectTypeRegistry.getInstance();
this.stackManager = new StackManager(this.stateManager, config.players);
this.triggerDetector = new TriggerDetector(this.stateManager, this.stackManager);
this.requirementValidator = new RequirementValidator(this.stateManager);
```

### ActionProcessor.ts Enhancement

```typescript
// Enhanced constructor with Phase 6 components
constructor(
  private stateManager: GameStateManager,
  private cardManager: CardManager,
  private boardManager: BoardManager,
  private phaseManager: PhaseManager,
  private effectRegistry?: EffectTypeRegistry,
  private stackManager?: StackManager,
  private triggerDetector?: TriggerDetector,
  private requirementValidator?: RequirementValidator
) {}

// New action card processing with Phase 6 integration
private processActionCard(...) {
  // Effect validation, stack addition, event emission
}
```
