- **Production-Ready Foundation**: Complete 9-component architecture with effects system ✅ **Achieved**

### Game Design Innovation

- **Dynamic Role System**: Multi-tier advancement across 3 specialized families ✅ **Implemented**
- **Equipment Modularity**: Customizable summons with weapons, armor, and accessories ✅ **Implemented**
- **Stack-Based Combat**: Precise timing control with Action/Reaction/Counter mechanics ✅ **Implemented**
- **Effects Engine**: LIFO stack resolution with priority ordering and event-driven interactions ✅ **Implemented**

## Design Philosophy

### Data-Driven Interpretation

This project follows a **data-driven interpretation** approach where the game engine acts as an interpreter for structured data rather than executing hardcoded logic:

- **Game rules are data, not code** - All mechanics are defined in JSON/TypeScript structures
- **Engine interprets structured data** - The core system reads and processes game rules dynamically
- **Content creation through data editing** - Adding new cards, effects, or mechanics requires only data changes
- **Enables rapid iteration** - Balance changes and new content can be implemented without code changes

### Authoritative Server Mindset

The architecture treats the game engine as an authoritative server, even in single-player mode:

- **Engine as single source of truth** - All game state changes flow through the engine
- **Action-based commands** - UI components submit actions, never direct state changes
- **Event-driven updates** - Components react to engine state changes
- **Multiplayer-ready design** - Architecture supports future networked gameplay
