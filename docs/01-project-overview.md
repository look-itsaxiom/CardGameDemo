# Project Overview

## Vision & Goals

The Card Game Demo is a tactical grid-based RPG card game designed as a comprehensive showcase of modern game development architecture. This project demonstrates a data-driven, extensible game engine that can serve as the foundation for a full-featured multiplayer card game.

## Core Objectives

### Technical Excellence

-   **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation with zero `any` types
-   **Data-Driven Design**: All game mechanics defined as structured data, not hardcoded logic
-   **Modular Architecture**: Strict separation between engine, UI, and data layers
-   **Future-Proof Foundation**: Server-ready architecture for multiplayer expansion

### Game Design Innovation

-   **Unique Summon System**: Procedurally generated cards with digital provenance
-   **Dynamic Role System**: Multi-tier advancement across 3 specialized families
-   **Equipment Modularity**: Customizable summons with weapons, armor, and accessories
-   **Stack-Based Combat**: Precise timing control with Action/Reaction/Counter mechanics

## Design Philosophy

### Data-Driven Interpretation

This project follows a **data-driven interpretation** approach where the game engine acts as an interpreter for structured data rather than executing hardcoded logic:

-   **Game rules are data, not code** - All mechanics are defined in JSON/TypeScript structures
-   **Engine interprets structured data** - The core system reads and processes game rules dynamically
-   **Content creation through data editing** - Adding new cards, effects, or mechanics requires only data changes
-   **Enables rapid iteration** - Balance changes and new content can be implemented without code changes

### Authoritative Server Mindset

The architecture treats the game engine as an authoritative server, even in single-player mode:

-   **Engine as single source of truth** - All game state changes flow through the engine
-   **Action-based commands** - UI components submit actions, never direct state changes
-   **Event-driven updates** - Components react to engine state changes
-   **Multiplayer-ready design** - Architecture supports future networked gameplay

### Key Systems

#### Digital Provenance System

-   **Unique Summon Cards**: Each card has cryptographic signature with timestamp and opener
-   **Immutable Provenance**: Creates traceable ownership chains for trading
-   **Template-Based Generation**: Species templates with stat ranges and trait effects

#### Role Advancement Trees

-   **Three Families**: Warrior, Scout, and Magician specializations
-   **Multi-Tier Progression**: Linear advancement with branching convergence at Tier 3
-   **Dynamic Role Changes**: Roles can be modified during gameplay via Advance cards

#### Effect System

-   **Stack-Based Resolution**: Action/Reaction/Counter speed levels with precise timing
-   **Trigger/Response Framework**: Data-driven event system for complex interactions
-   **Requirement Validation**: Extensible constraint system for effect activation
