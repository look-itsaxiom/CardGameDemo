# Card Game Dem## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

**Version:** 0.0.3 - Alpha Set Complete  
**Phase:** Game Engine Core Loop Implementation  
**Progress:** 37/37 Alpha cards implemented, 89% play example coverage

### Recent Achievements

-   âœ… Complete Alpha set implementation with TypeScript type safety
-   âœ… Comprehensive role system (13 roles, 3 families)
-   âœ… Data-driven card architecture with automated build system
-   âœ… Digital provenance system for unique card tracking

### Next Priorities

-   ðŸ”„ Authoritative game engine implementation
-   ðŸ”„ Turn-based phase system
-   ðŸ”„ Stack-based effect resolution
-   ðŸ“‹ UI development (Phaser 3 + React)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build and validate cards
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

## ï¿½ Demo Features

-   **3v3 Tactical Combat** - Strategic grid-based battles
-   **Unique Summon System** - Procedurally generated cards with digital signatures
-   **Role Advancement** - Multi-tier progression across 3 families
-   **Equipment Modularity** - Customize summons with weapons, armor, and accessories
-   **Data-Driven Design** - All mechanics defined as structured data

## ðŸ“š Architecture Highlights

-   **Type Safety**: 200+ TypeScript interfaces, zero `any` types
-   **Data-Driven**: Game mechanics as interpreted JSON, not hardcoded logic
-   **Modular Design**: Strict separation between engine, UI, and data layers
-   **Future-Proof**: Server-ready architecture for multiplayer expansion
