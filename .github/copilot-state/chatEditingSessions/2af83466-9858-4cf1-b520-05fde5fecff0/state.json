UI Layer\r\n- **React UI:** Deck builder, card collection, menus, and game setup.\r\n- **Phaser 3 Board:** Visualizes the board, units, and in-play actions.\r\n- **UI-State Sync:** Subscribes to game state updates and renders accordingly. Sends user actions to the engine.\r\n\r\n### 4. Extensibility & Testing\r\n- **Data-Driven Expansion:** New cards, effects, and mechanics added via data, not code changes.\r\n- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Test game logic, state transitions, and effect resolution.\r\n- **Debug Tools:** UI for inspecting state, simulating actions, and visualizing the stack.\r\n\r\n### 5.

Data Layer\r\n- **Card Definitions:** All card types, effects, triggers, requirements, and stats defined in JSON or TypeScript interfaces.\r\n- **Decks & Collections:** Player decks, collections, and stubbed user data.\r\n- **Board & Zones:** Board layout, zones, and initial state.\r\n\r\n### 2. Game Engine (Authoritative Logic)\r\n- **State Management:** Holds the canonical game state (board, hands, decks, discard, etc.).\r\n- **Action Interpreter:** Receives user actions (play card, move unit, attack, etc.), validates them, and applies state changes.\r\n- **Effect/Trigger System:** Evaluates triggers, requirements, and resolves effects using data definitions.\r\n- **Stack & Priority:** Manages the stack, responses, and resolution order.\r\n- **Stat Calculation:** Computes unit stats, damage, healing, and other derived values from data.\r\n- **Victory/End Conditions:** Checks for win/loss/draw and game over.\r\n\r\n### 3. UI Layer\r\n- **React UI:** Deck builder, card collection, menus, and game setup.\r\n- **Phaser 3 Board:** Visualizes the board, units, and in-play actions.\r\n- **UI-State Sync:** Subscribes to game state updates and renders accordingly. Sends user actions to the engine.\r\n\r\n### 4. Extensibility & Testing\r\n- **Data-Driven Expansion:** New cards, effects, and mechanics added via data, not code changes.\r\n- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Test game logic, state transitions, and effect resolution.\r\n- **Debug Tools:** UI for inspecting state, simulating actions, and visualizing the stack.\r\n\r\n### 5.

The engine is an interpreter, not a collection of bespoke scripts. This means:\r\n\r\n- **Every card, effect, and rule is defined as data.** The engine reads and interprets this data to drive gameplay, rather than relying on custom code for each new mechanic.\r\n- **Adding or changing content is a matter of editing data, not writing new logic.** This empowers designers and future developers to expand the game without deep engine changes.\r\n- **The system is future-proof and extensible.** New mechanics, card types, or even whole new game modes can be introduced by extending the data schema and interpreter, not by rewriting the core.\r\n- **Separation of concerns is absolute.** The UI is a client that submits actions and renders state; the engine is the sole authority on game rules and state transitions.\r\n- **This approach is chosen to enable rapid iteration, robust testing, and a clear path to multiplayer and live service features.**\r\n\r\nThe goal is to create a living, evolving game system that can grow and adapt as new ideas emerge, without ever becoming brittle or unmaintainable.\r\n\r\n## System Breakdown & Architecture Overview\r\n\r\n### 1. Data Layer\r\n- **Card Definitions:** All card types, effects, triggers, requirements, and stats defined in JSON or TypeScript interfaces.\r\n- **Decks & Collections:** Player decks, collections, and stubbed user data.\r\n- **Board & Zones:** Board layout, zones, and initial state.\r\n\r\n### 2. Game Engine (Authoritative Logic)\r\n- **State Management:** Holds the canonical game state (board, hands, decks, discard, etc.).\r\n- **Action Interpreter:** Receives user actions (play card, move unit, attack, etc.), validates them, and applies state changes.\r\n- **Effect/Trigger System:** Evaluates triggers, requirements, and resolves effects using data definitions.\r\n- **Stack & Priority:** Manages the stack, responses, and resolution order.\r\n- **Stat Calculation:** Computes unit stats, damage, healing, and other derived values from data.\r\n- **Victory/End Conditions:** Checks for win/loss/draw and game over.\r\n\r\n### 3. UI Layer\r\n- **React UI:** Deck builder, card collection, menus, and game setup.\r\n- **Phaser 3 Board:** Visualizes the board, units, and in-play actions.\r\n- **UI-State Sync:** Subscribes to game state updates and renders accordingly. Sends user actions to the engine.\r\n\r\n### 4. Extensibility & Testing\r\n- **Data-Driven Expansion:** New cards, effects, and mechanics added via data, not code changes.\r\n- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Test game logic, state transitions, and effect resolution.\r\n- **Debug Tools:** UI for inspecting state, simulating actions, and visualizing the stack.\r\n\r\n### 5. Future-Proofing\r\n- **Server-Client Split:** Engine is designed to run headless (server-side) or in-browser (client-side) with the same API.\r\n- **Networking Ready:** All user actions are serializable and replayable for multiplayer or server validation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next: Top-Level Entity Map & Relationships\r\n- **Goal:** Clearly define the main entities (GameState, Player, Card, Board, Action, etc.) and how they interact, so that every part of the game has a place in the data model.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n  - All major game concepts from the play example are represented as entities or relationships.\r\n  - Relationships between entities (e.g., Player owns Deck, Board contains Units) are explicit.\r\n  - A diagram or table shows how everything fits together.\r\n\r\n## Next: Card & Effect Schema Design\r\n- **Goal:** Create TypeScript interfaces for all card types, effects, triggers, requirements, and actions, so that every mechanic in the play example can be described in data.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n  - Every card in the play example can be represented as a data object.\r\n  - Effects, triggers, and requirements are data-driven and extensible.\r\n  - Adding a new card or mechanic is possible without engine code changes.\r\n  - Example card data objects are included for reference.\r\n\r\n## Next: Game Engine Core Loop\r\n- **Goal:** Outline and implement the main phases and state transitions (Draw, Level, Action, End, etc.), and define how user actions are submitted, validated, and resolved by the engine.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n  - The full turn cycle is implemented and matches the play example.\r\n  - Actions (play card, move, attack, etc.) are submitted as data and processed by the engine.\r\n  - The stack, triggers, and resolutions are handled according to the rules.\r\n  - The engine can be run headless for testing.\r\n\r\n## Next: UI & Client Integration\r\n- **Goal:** Connect React and Phaser 3 to the engine, so that the UI reflects game state and user actions are sent to the engine, not handled directly in the UI.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n  - UI updates in response to state changes from the engine.\r\n  - All user actions (clicks, drags, selections) are sent as data to the engine.\r\n  - No game logic is duplicated in the UI layer.\r\n  - The UI can be swapped or updated without breaking the engine.\r\n\r\n## Next: Testing & Debugging Tools\r\n- **Goal:** Provide tools for testing and debugging the game logic, including unit/integration tests and a debug UI for inspecting state and simulating actions.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n  - Core engine logic is covered by automated tests.\r\n  - Developers can inspect the stack, triggers, and state transitions in real time.\r\n  - Simulated actions and test scenarios can be run without the full UI.\r\n\r\n## Next: Roadmap to Full Product\r\n- **Goal:** Identify the steps needed to evolve the MVP into a full-stack, multiplayer, live product, including backend, networking, and live ops features.\r\n- **Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n  - A clear migration path from local MVP to server-authoritative multiplayer is documented.\r\n  - Key backend features (auth, persistence, matchmaking, etc.) are listed.\r\n  - The architecture supports future live updates and content drops.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*This document is a living master plan. Each section will be expanded and refined as the project evolves.*\r\n","pos":0,"len":0}],"state":0,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22d19944f6-f46c-4e17-911b-79a8e843c7c0%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]},{"requestId":"request_4047661d-4a38-4fe1-9a1d-10584f2f83bb","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_4047661d-4a38-4fe1-9a1d-10584f2f83bb%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]}]},{"requestId":"request_57802c15-e43c-4402-a759-da611830b711","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_57802c15-e43c-4402-a759-da611830b711%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]}]},{"requestId":"request_d30ab93c-2e7a-464d-8744-c73bd09d0d6b","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_d30ab93c-2e7a-464d-8744-c73bd09d0d6b%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]}]},{"requestId":"request_967f6d5f-0a2f-4056-9353-4205ecb7b5b6","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_967f6d5f-0a2f-4056-9353-4205ecb7b5b6%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]}]},{"requestId":"request_f67abc76-594e-414a-beed-961b29ffbc11","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_f67abc76-594e-414a-beed-961b29ffbc11%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]}]},{"requestId":"request_924d1ddc-b7d0-46f8-92c9-3aced50abab1","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_924d1ddc-b7d0-46f8-92c9-3aced50abab1%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetryInfo":{"requestId":"request_db862bf9-5b4a-42e1-aab6-63a86a7ad247","agentId":"github.copilot.editsAgent"}}]}]},{"requestId":"request_3a579396-2ffb-4955-95ce-1253d267e453","stops":[{"entries":[{"resource":"file:///c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md","languageId":"markdown","originalHash":"309ba03","currentHash":"309ba03","originalToCurrentEdit":[],"state":1,"snapshotUri":"chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Users/cskib/Projects/CardGameDemo/.github/project.md?%7B%22sessionId%22%3A%222af83466-9858-4cf1-b520-05fde5fecff0%22%2C%22requestId%22%3A%22request_3a579396-2ffb-4955-95ce-1253d267e453%22%2C%22undoStop%22%3A%22%22%7D","telemetry
