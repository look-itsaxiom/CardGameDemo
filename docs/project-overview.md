# Project Master Plan: Tactical Card Game Demo

## Vision

Deliver a robust, extensible, and data-driven tactical RPG card game demo. The MVP is a self-contained, local snapshot of the larger product, focused on the core gameplay loop, data models, and extensibility. This demo will serve as the foundation for future expansion into a full-stack, multiplayer, authoritative-server product.

## MVP Goals

-   All game data (cards, decks, board, etc.) is defined in TypeScript interfaces and/or static JSON, not hardcoded logic.
-   The game engine is modular, with strict separation between game logic (engine/state) and UI (Phaser/React).
-   The core gameplay loop (turns, phases, actions, triggers, stack, win/loss) is fully implemented and testable.
-   The system is designed for easy extension: new cards, mechanics, or rules can be added by editing data, not code.
-   UI is functional and clear, using React for menus/collection/deckbuilder and Phaser 3 for the board/gameplay.
-   No backend, authentication, or real-time multiplayer—just local, stubbed data and single-session play.

## Core Design Pillars

1. **Data-Driven Game Logic**

    - All card effects, requirements, triggers, and rules are defined in structured data (JSON/TypeScript), not as bespoke scripts per card.
    - The engine interprets this data to drive all gameplay mechanics.

2. **Separation of Concerns**

    - Game logic (engine/state) is completely decoupled from UI (Phaser/React).
    - The UI is a “dumb” renderer and input collector, never the source of truth.

3. **Authoritative Server Mindset**
    - The architecture treats the game engine as the “server” and the UI as “clients” that submit actions and receive state updates.
    - This enables a future transition to a true backend authoritative server with minimal refactor.

## Design Ethos: Interpretation Over Hardcoding

This project is built on the principle that the rules, effects, and content of the game are not hardcoded, but interpreted from structured data. The engine is an interpreter, not a collection of bespoke scripts. This means:

-   **Every card, effect, and rule is defined as data.** The engine reads and interprets this data to drive gameplay, rather than relying on custom code for each new mechanic.
-   **Adding or changing content is a matter of editing data, not writing new logic.** This empowers designers (me) and future developers (still me) to expand the game without deep engine changes.
-   **The system is future-proof and extensible.** New mechanics, card types, or even whole new game modes can be introduced by extending the data schema and interpreter, not by rewriting the core.
-   **Separation of concerns is absolute.** The UI is a client that submits actions and renders state; the engine is the sole authority on game rules and state transitions.
-   **This approach is chosen to enable rapid iteration, robust testing, and a clear path to multiplayer and live service features.**

The goal is to create a living, evolving game system that can grow and adapt as new ideas emerge, without ever becoming brittle or unmaintainable.

## System Breakdown & Architecture Overview

### 1. Data Layer

-   **Card Definitions:** All card types, effects, triggers, requirements, and stats defined in JSON or TypeScript interfaces.
-   **Decks & Collections:** Player decks, collections, and stubbed user data.
-   **Board & Zones:** Board layout, zones, and initial state.

### 2. Game Engine (Authoritative Logic)

-   **State Management:** Holds the canonical game state (board, hands, decks, discard, etc.).
-   **Action Interpreter:** Receives user actions (play card, move unit, attack, etc.), validates them, and applies state changes.
-   **Effect/Trigger System:** Evaluates triggers, requirements, and resolves effects using data definitions.
-   **Stack & Priority:** Manages the stack, responses, and resolution order.
-   **Stat Calculation:** Computes unit stats, damage, healing, and other derived values from data.
-   **Victory/End Conditions:** Checks for win/loss/draw and game over.

### 3. UI Layer

-   **React UI:** Deck builder, card collection, menus, and game setup.
-   **Phaser 3 Board:** Visualizes the board, units, and in-play actions.
-   **UI-State Sync:** Subscribes to game state updates and renders accordingly. Sends user actions to the engine.

### 4. Extensibility & Testing

-   **Data-Driven Expansion:** New cards, effects, and mechanics added via data, not code changes.
-   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Test game logic, state transitions, and effect resolution.
-   **Debug Tools:** UI for inspecting state, simulating actions, and visualizing the stack.

### 5. Future-Proofing

-   **Server-Client Split:** Engine is designed to run headless (server-side) or in-browser (client-side) with the same API.
-   **Networking Ready:** All user actions are serializable and replayable for multiplayer or server validation.

## Key Design Clarifications & Discoveries

### Summon Card System

-   **Digital Provenance:** Each Summon card generated from packs has a unique digital signature with timestamp and opener identity, creating immutable provenance chains for trading/collecting.
-   **Dynamic Equipment:** Equipment can be modified during gameplay on Summon Units, but Summon Slot configurations in decks serve as starting loadouts.
-   **Modular Roles:** Roles function like equipment - modifiable in deck building and changeable during gameplay via Advance cards.
-   **True Uniqueness:** No duplicate summons possible; even statistically identical summons are fundamentally different due to unique generation signatures.

### Equipment & Role Card Economy

-   **Equipment as Collectibles:** Equipment cards are their own card type with rarities, pulled from packs independently of summons.
-   **Role Card Tiers:** Tier 1 roles (Warrior, Magician, Scout) are provided; Tier 2+ roles and their Advance cards must be collected.
-   **Role Advancement Paths:**
    -   Tier 1 → Tier 2: Linear progression (1-3 options per Tier 1)
    -   Tier 2 → Tier 3: Branching convergence with significant overlap
    -   Example: Paladin accessible via Warrior→Knight→Paladin OR Magician→Light Mage→Paladin
    -   Multi-path Tier 3 roles satisfy requirements from multiple source trees
-   **Tier Lock Requirements:** Advance cards typically require specific tier prerequisites (Tier 2 Advance needs Tier 1 role, etc.)

### Game State Isolation

-   **No Persistence:** Battle outcomes don't permanently affect card properties or player collections.
-   **Future "Ranking Up":** Card progression mechanics planned but outside demo scope.
-   **Pure Game State:** All modifications during gameplay are temporary state changes, not permanent card alterations.

### Technical Integration Notes

-   **boardgame.io Integration:** Perfect fit for turn-based phases, authoritative state, and multiplayer support. Game phases map directly to boardgame.io phases.
-   **Effect System Approach:** Considering json-rules-engine vs custom event/trigger system for data-driven effects. Custom approach may be better for stack-based resolution with speed levels and priority passing.

    -   UI updates in response to state changes from the engine.
    -   All user actions (clicks, drags, selections) are sent as data to the engine.
    -   No game logic is duplicated in the UI layer.
